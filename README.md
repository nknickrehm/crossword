# Crossword puzzle generator

This is a primitive web-based generator for crossword puzzles. It can generate a crossword puzzle out of a given set of words.

The visibility of the words can be toggled and both the riddle and its solution can be exported to a PNG image file.

Additional hints can be written inside the gray boxes in front of the words. Those hints are included in the PNG export of the puzzle and its solution. 

This application uses [html2canvas](https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/) for the PNG export.

To see how this generator works, have a look on [this blog post on my personal website](https://nikolask.de/crossword-generator/).
